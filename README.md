# Filipe Teixeira
Hi! I'm Filipe Teixeira, a Software Engineer from Porto, Portugal.

Throughout my career, I've worked on projects across various industries, including energy, medical devices, metrology, telecommunications, and transportation. This page showcases some of the personal projects I've developed or contributed to.

_Note: This list doesn't include all my work. Some projects are private, either personal or tied to the companies I've worked with._

This list is work in progress, and I'll keep adding more projects as I find the time to write about them.

## Go
- [Go Coin API](https://github.com/filipeoliv02/Go-Coin-API) is an HTTP API written in Go that provides endpoints for retrieving account balances and handling errors. The API is designed to manage coin balances, respond with structured JSON data, and handle various error conditions gracefully. It utilizes the encoding/json and net/http libraries for JSON encoding and HTTP request handling, respectively. The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow configured to build and test the application on every push and pull request to the master branch, ensuring continuous integration and code quality. This project demonstrates how to use Go's standard library to build a simple HTTP API, along with integration with GitHub Actions for automated testing. It highlights key features like error handling and JSON encoding in Go, serving as a foundation for developing more complex APIs.

## Java
- [Random Player Generator](https://github.com/filipeoliv02/random-player-generator) is a Java application that generates random players with attributes such as names, countries, and various stats. It reads data from text files and assigns these attributes using random number generation. The program also calculates player physical attributes and outputs detailed player information. This project showcases Javaâ€™s file I/O operations, random number generation, and object-oriented programming principles.
## C#
- [SiUFP Grades](https://github.com/filipeoliv02/SiufpGrades) is a C# project that uses Selenium to automate the retrieval of grades from a university portal. The program logs into the system, checks for new grades, and alerts the user when new grades are published. This project was developed to address the lack of notification features from the school's portal. It demonstrates the use of web automation with Selenium in C#, including techniques for handling dynamic web content, managing authentication, and executing automated browser tasks.

## C
- [Sudoku X Solver](https://github.com/filipeoliv02/Sudoku_X_Solver) is a C program that solves Sudoku X puzzles, a variant of the classic Sudoku game that includes two additional diagonal constraints. The program can generate and solve Sudoku X puzzles of varying difficulty levels, providing a challenging experience for puzzle enthusiasts. It demonstrates the use of multiple algorithms to solve combinatorial problems efficiently and showcases C programming techniques for handling multidimensional arrays and recursive functions.
- [Reservation System](https://github.com/filipeoliv02/Reservation-System) was designed to manage reservations for a local accommodation company. The system integrates with multiple rental platforms, synchronizes calendars, handles events like cleaning or maintenance, and resolves overbookings. It uses dynamic data structures like linked lists and dynamic arrays to manage buildings, studios, guests, and reservations. Algorithms such as binary search, conflict resolution, and dynamic pricing calculation optimize the system's performance. This project demonstrates efficient handling of file I/O, pointer manipulation, and memory management in C, with a focus on real-world accommodation management challenges.

## Shell
- [PDF Search](https://github.com/filipeoliv02/pdf-search/) is a shell script that allows users to search for a specific string within all PDF files in a given directory. It can perform the search recursively through subdirectories and displays the results in a simple interactive menu, allowing users to open the selected PDF file directly. This project demonstrates how to use Bash scripting for efficient file searching and manipulation. It leverages tools like `pdfgrep` for string matching in PDF files, integrates file I/O operations, and provides an interactive command-line interface. Additionally, the script showcases argument parsing, recursive directory traversal, and dynamic file opening using `xdg-open`, making it a useful tool for automating PDF searches.
